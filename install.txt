Installation of CACTUS for Linux or Mac machines.

1. Unzip the directory and put in desired location. On terminal cd into the 
   correct directory (you should be able to see the makefiles).

2. Create the executable by typing:
     $make
   or
     $make -f Makefile.gfortran
   on the terminal. The executable will be called 'cactus' and be located in the
   directory one level above.You can add the executable's location to your path 
   so that you can call it by simple typing 'cactus' on the terminal instead of
   the complete path. 

3. cd into the Test/RegTest directory
     $cd ./Test/RegTest
   and run the RegTest by executing runreg.py with the path to the CACTUS 
   executable as an argument (or just the name of the executable if you added it 
   to your path).
     $./runreg.py ../../../cactus
   or
     $./runreg.py cactus
   The output should say 'No differences' for all three tests. Note: if you have 
   Python 3 installed used runreg_p3.py instead.


CONGRATULATIONS! You have successfully installed CACTUS.

4. To be able to use the DAKOTA-CACTUS interface you will need to download 
   DAKOTA and OCTAVE. Follow instructions in their respective websites. If 
   installed correctly, and all environment variables and path are set correctly
   you should be able to type on the terminal:
     $ dakota -version
     $ octave -version
   and get details on the installed versions.

5. Run the CACTUS-DAKOTA Check ... (not ready yet)

CONGRATULATIONS! You have CACTUS-DAKOTA successfully running on your system.
